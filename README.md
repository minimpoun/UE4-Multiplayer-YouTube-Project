# UE4 Multiplayer YouTube Project
## Source Code for my YouTube Tutorial Series "Making Multiplayer Games with UE4 the Correct Way"

No .uproject file or content folder will be supplied on GitHub due to size limitations 
as well as due to the use of Marketplace content such as weapon models or particle effects.
This might change in the future, we'll see.

All resources required to follow along with this tutorial series will be provided in the description
of each video. There will also be a master list in this Repo.

This series is completely free and will always be free. If you ever find this series or any of the content used in this series on any paid platform or locked behind a pay wall please report it to me as I did not upload it there. With the expection of my personal Patron page. Becoming a Patron is in no way required for you to get everything out of this series, however it's a way to show support for the amount of time I've put into developing this series.

#### How will the series be broken up?
The series will consist of 15 confirmed Blocks (possibly more in the future) that cover each of the topics described below.
Each Block will build off the previous Block; however it will be designed so that we
build a complete system in each Block to allow you to jump around to the things you want to learn.
